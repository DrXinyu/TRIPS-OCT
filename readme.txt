Run TRIPS_Mueller_reconstruction.m to evaluate the code for TRIPS-OCT Mueller matrix reconstruction.
Run TRIPS_PMD_and_symmetrization.m to evaluate the code for spectral binning to mitigate PMD and recover symmetry.

Detailed fundtions in comments.

Data: 
One trypical guinea pig retina frame in-vivo
S123.mat is the Stokes vectors of the B-scan to be reconstructed.
bigS123.mat is the Stokes vectors to generate calibration metrics, randomly selected from the volume scan.

System requirement:
GPU: above GTX1080Ti is recommended.
