# OpticAxis
Matlab routines to reconstruct polarization-sensitive signals from OFDI measurements, including local retardation, optic axis orientation, and degree of polarization. 

##General comment
PS reconstruction functions generally take reconstructed (and spectrally binned) Stokes vectors as input arguments.
